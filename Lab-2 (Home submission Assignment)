Objective-2 (Pseudocode):
Task-02: (Adding numbers without using “+” operator)
1. Start
2. 
3. // Input/Output
4. INPUT num1
5. INPUT num2
6. INPUT num3
7. 
8. // Variables and Initialization
9. Set sum to 0
10. 
11. // Process Steps
12. Set sum to num1 - (-num2) - (-num3)
13. // Output
14. Print sum
15. End


Task-03: (Creating a simple Calculator which has only “+” and “-” operations
1. Start
2. 
3. // Input/Output
4. INPUT num1
5. INPUT num2


6. INPUT operator (+ or -)
7. 
8. // Variables and Initialization
9. Set result to 0
10. 
11. // Process Steps
12. (These steps will be handled in conditional statement)
13. 
14. // Conditional statement
15. If operator = “+”
16. set result to num1 + num2
17. Else (If operator is “-“, did not really need to specify)
18. set result to num1 - num2
// Output
14. Print result
15. End

Objective 3 (Algorithm):
Task-01
1. Ask the user to enter Nth (Divisor).
2. Ask the user to enter n (Dividend).
3. Determine if Nth is a divisor of n.
4. If n divided by Nth (n/Nth) has no remainder (i.e remainder = 0), then Nth is a divisor of n.
5. If n divided by Nth has a remainder (i.e remainder ≠ 0), then Nth is not a divisor of n.
6. Determine if result of n/Nth is even or Odd.
7. If result divided by 2 (Nth/2) has no remainder, then it is even, else result is odd.
9. Print whether Nth is divisor of n or not.
10. Print whether result (i.e n/Nth) is even or odd.


Task-03:
1. Ask the user to enter first number.
2. Ask the user to enter operator (+, -, *, /, %).
3. Ask the user to enter second number.
4. If operator is +, set result to first number + second number.
5. If operator is -, set result to first number - second number.
6. If operator is *, set result to first number * second number.
7. If operator is / and second number is not 0, set result to first number / second number, 
    else, set result to “error”.
8. If operator is % and second number is not 0, set result to second number/100 * first 
    number, else, set result to “error”.
9. Print result.
